# Gaming site project
I will try to create some sort of simple games and other excercises that keep track of things such as highscores per user. Account creation will be possible and users will be able to make groups that others are able to join. There will be account pages where users can do stuff like write about themselves and display game scores and liked games, or something like that. There will probably be many more functionalities.

Since I have had some struggles with setting up PostgreSQL, I have been focusing more on flask and how I should build up the site. Currently my project is not in a state worthwhile testing, however, so I will instead make sure I get everything up and working correctly for the next testing.
